The problem it's trying to solve?
Trying to avoid class explosion. So suppose you want had incremtal features like
maybe a macbook, so might have to make a class which is like what I've defined, a lot of if and switch cases which might not
be ideal, and you might have to make a lot of classes being macbookWith16gb ram and macbookWith32gb and something like that.
better is to do some decorato patter
